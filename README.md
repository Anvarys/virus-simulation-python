## Installing and using python simulation
#### 0. Installing poetry
<i>If you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed then skip this step.</i><br>
Windows: `pip install poetry`<br>
Unix based OS (Linux, macOS, etc.): `pip3 install poetry`

### TODO:

1. Web version of the 2d simulation
2. Make it not ugly
3. Publish web version via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
4. Web version of X dimensional simulation
5. Graphics for X dimensional web simulation
6. Web version of the 3d simulation (prob would crash any browser)
7. Create other simulations (like civilisations)

For Axiom I'm expecting to get to 5th or 6th point in my TODO
